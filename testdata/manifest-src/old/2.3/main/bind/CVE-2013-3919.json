  "IssueID": 2070,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2013-3919",
  "Release": "2.3",
  "Package": "bind",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "9.8.5_p1-r0",
  "Subject": "[v2.3] bind: A recursive resolver can be crashed by a query for a malformed zone (CVE-2013-3919)",
  "Description": "h3. Versions affected: \r\n\r\nBIND 9.6-ESV-R9, 9.8.5, and 9.9.3 are affected\r\n\r\nVersions 9.6.0 through 9.6-ESV-R8, 9.8.0 through 9.8.4-P2, and 9.9.0 through 9.9.2-P2 ARE NOT affected.\r\n\r\nOther major branches of BIND (e.g. 9.7, 9.5, etc) are not vulnerable but they are no longer supported by ISC and may lack other important security fixes.\r\n\r\nh3. Severity:\r\n\r\nHigh\r\n\r\nh3. Exploitable:\r\n\r\nRemotely\r\n\r\nh3. Description:\r\n\r\nA bug has been discovered in the most recent releases of BIND 9 which has the potential for deliberate exploitation as a denial-of-service attack. By sending a recursive resolver a query for a record in a specially malformed zone, an attacker can cause BIND 9 to exit with a fatal \"RUNTIME_CHECK\" error in resolver.c\r\n\r\nh3. Impact:\r\n\r\nTriggering this defect will cause the affected server to exit with an error, denying service to recursive DNS clients that use that particular server.\r\n\r\nh3. CVSS Score:  7.8\r\n\r\nh3. CVSS Equation:  (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System and to obtain your specific environmental score please visit: http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator\u0026adv\u0026version=2\u0026vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C%29\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nh3. Active exploits:\r\n\r\nAt the time of this advisory no intentional exploitation of this bug has been observed in the wild. However, the existence of the issue has been disclosed on an open mailing list with enough accompanying detail to reverse engineer an attack and ISC is therefore treating this as a Type II (publicly disclosed) vulnerability, in accordance with our Phased Disclosure Process.\r\n\r\nh3. Solution: \r\n\r\nNew versions of BIND are being provided which contain a fix for the defect. The recommended solution is to upgrade to the patched release most closely related to your current version of BIND. These can all be downloaded from http://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9\r\n\r\n    BIND 9 version 9.9.3-P1\r\n    BIND 9 version 9.8.5-P1\r\n    BIND 9 version 9.6-ESV-R9-P1\r\n\r\nh3. Acknowledgements:\r\n\r\nh3. Document Revision History:\r\n\r\n1.0 Type II Public Disclosure, 04 June, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Questions regarding this advisory should go to security-officer@isc.org\r\n\r\nNote: ISC patches only currently supported versions. When possible we indicate EOL versions affected.\r\n\r\nISC Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:  Details of our current security advisory policy and practice can be found here: ISC Software Defect and Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\r\n\r\nThis Knowledge Base article https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00967 is the complete and official security advisory document."
