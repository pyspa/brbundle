  "IssueID": 1109,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2012-2110",
  "Release": "2.2",
  "Package": "openssl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.0.0i-r0",
  "Subject": "[v2.2] openssl: ASN1 BIO vulnerability (CVE-2012-2110)",
  "Description": "A potentially exploitable vulnerability has been discovered in the OpenSSL\r\nfunction asn1_d2i_read_bio.\r\n\r\nAny application which uses BIO or FILE based functions to read untrusted DER\r\nformat data is vulnerable. Affected functions are of the form d2i_*_bio or\r\nd2i_*_fp, for example d2i_X509_bio or d2i_PKCS12_fp.\r\n\r\nApplications using the memory based ASN1 functions (d2i_X509, d2i_PKCS12 etc)\r\nare not affected. In particular the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL is *not* affected.\r\n\r\nApplications only using the PEM routines are not affected.\r\n\r\nS/MIME or CMS applications using the built in MIME parser SMIME_read_PKCS7 or\r\nSMIME_read_CMS *are* affected.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSSL command line utility is also affected if used to process untrusted\r\ndata in DER format.\r\n\r\nNote: although an application using the SSL/TLS portions of OpenSSL is not\r\nautomatically affected it might still call a function such as d2i_X509_bio on\r\nuntrusted data and be vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThanks to Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, for discovering this issue and\r\nto Adam Langley \u003cagl@chromium.org\u003e for fixing it.\r\n\r\nAffected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1a, 1.0.0i or 0.9.8v.\r\n\r\nh3.
