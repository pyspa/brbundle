  "Subject": "[v2.2] openssl: CMS and S/MIME Bleichenbacher attack (CVE-2012-0884)",
  "Description": "h2. OpenSSL Security Advisory [12 Mar 2012]\r\n\r\nh3. CMS and S/MIME Bleichenbacher attack (CVE-2012-0884)\r\n\r\nA weakness in the OpenSSL CMS and PKCS #7 code can be exploited\r\nusing Bleichenbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA padding\r\nalso known as the million message attack (MMA).\r\n\r\nOnly users of CMS, PKCS #7, or S/MIME decryption operations are affected. A\r\nsuccessful attack needs on average 2^20 messages. In practice only automated\r\nsystems will be affected as humans will not be willing to process this many\r\nmessages.\r\n\r\nSSL/TLS applications are *NOT* affected by this problem since the \r\nSSL/TLS code does not use the PKCS#7 or CMS decryption code. \r\n\r\nThanks to Ivan Nestlerode \u003cinestlerode@us.ibm.com\u003e for discovering\r\nthis weakness.\r\n\r\nThe fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.\r\n\r\nAffected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.0h or 0.9.8u.\r\n\r\nh3.
