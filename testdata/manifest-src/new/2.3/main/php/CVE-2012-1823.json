  "Description": "https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=61910\r\n\r\nCVE: CVE-2012-1823\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS:\r\nphp\r\nphp-cgi\r\n\r\nh2. OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nPHP-CGI-based setups contain a vulnerability when parsing query\r\nstring parameters from php files.\r\n\r\nh2. DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nAccording to PHP's website, \"PHP is a widely-used general-purpose\r\nscripting language that is especially suited for Web development and\r\ncan be embedded into HTML.\" When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup\r\n(such as Apache's mod_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query\r\nstring parameter as command line arguments which allows command-line\r\nswitches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary,\r\nwhich can be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary\r\ncode execution.\r\n\r\nAn example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source\r\ncode of index.php is below:\r\nhttp://localhost/index.php?-s\r\n\r\nh2. IMPACT\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could obtain sensitive information,\r\ncause a denial of service condition or may be able to execute\r\narbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.\r\n\r\nh2. SOLUTION\r\n\r\nWe are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nh2. REFERENCES\r\n\r\nhttp://www.php.net/\r\nhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.php\r\n\r\nh2. CREDIT\r\n\r\nThanks to De Eindbazen for reporting this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis document was written by Michael Orlando.\r\n\r\n"
